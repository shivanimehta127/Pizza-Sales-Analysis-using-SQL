## 
**Project Title**: Pizza Sales Analysis

**Level**: Beginner  

**Database**: `pizzahut`

## 
This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze pizza sales data. The project involves setting up a pizza sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.


## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `pizzahut`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `order_details`` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, quantity.
 
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pizzahut;

USE pizzahut;

CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_details_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    pizza_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_details_id)
);
```


### 2. Data Analysis & Findings

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve the total number of orders placed.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_order
FROM
    orders;
```

2. **Write a SQL qurey calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price),

SELECT 
    pizzas.size,
    COUNT(order_details.order_details_id) AS order_count
FROM
    pizzas
        JOIN
    order_details ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizzas.size
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

5. **Write a SQL query to list the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    pizza_types.name, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS quantity
FROM
    pizza_types
        JOIN
    pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name
ORDER BY quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    pizza_types.category,
    SUM(order_details.quantity) AS quantity
FROM
    pizza_types
        JOIN
    pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.category
ORDER BY quantity DESC;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    HOUR(order_time) AS hour, COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY HOUR(order_time);
```

8. **Write a SQL query to join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category, COUNT(name)
FROM
    pizza_types
GROUP BY category;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(quantity), 0) AS avg_pizza_ordered_per_day
FROM
    (SELECT 
        orders.order_date, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS quantity

from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category, pizza_types.name) as a) as b
where rn <= 3;
```
